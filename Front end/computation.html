<summary> What is the difference between gross total income and total income?</summary>
<h5>Total Income is the income on which tax liability is determined. It is necessary to compute total income to ascertain tax liability .Section 80C to 80U provides certain deductions which can be claimed from Gross Total Income (GTI). After claiming these deductions from GTI, the income remaining is called as  Total Income. In other words, GTI less Deductions (under section 80C to 80U) = Total Income (TI). Total income can also be understood as taxable income. Following table gives a better understanding of the difference between GTI and TI :

 

Computation of gross total income and Taxable Income

Particulars	Amount
Income from salary	XXXXX
Income from house property	XXXXX
Profits and gains of business or profession	XXXXX
Capital gains	XXXXX
Income from other sources	XXXXX

<summary> How to round off total income before computing tax liability?</summary>
<h5> ​​​​As per section 288A​​, total income computed in accordance with the provisions of the Income-tax Law, shall be rounded off to the nearest multiple of ten. Following points should be kept in mind while rounding off the total income:

First any part of rupee consisting of any paisa should be ignored.
After ignoring paisa, if such amount is not in multiples of ten, and last figure in that amount is five or more, the amount shall be increased to the next higher amount which is in multiple of ten and if the last figure is less than five, the amount shall be reduced to the next lower amount which is in multiple of ten and the amount so rounded off shall be deemed to be the total income of the taxpayer.​

Illustration for better understanding

If the taxable income of Mr. Keshav is Rs. 2,52,844.99, then first paisa shall be ignored, i.e., 0.99 paisa shall be ignored) and  the remaining amount of Rs. 2,52,844 shall be rounded off to Rs. 2,52,840 (since last figure is less than five).
